# GTD Trello (Version 0.3.6)

This is an opensource Chrome extension for [Trello] that allows you to visualize your Trello boards in unique ways! It follows best practices borrowed from the [Agile], [GTD], and [4 Hour Work Week] methods... and bakes them right into your Trello board! The result?... Turning your Trello board into the ultimate platform for Getting Things Done!

### Current Features
Currently, the only way to use any of these features is by manually typing specific commands into the "List Title" name, or "Card Label" name. Eventually, all features will be enabled/disabled from an elegant popup menu.. but for now, bare with me.

* **Board Tabs:** Turns your Trello board into a "Folder Tab" structure <br>
* **List Labels:** Adds colored border to the top of lists for better organization <br>
* **List Separators:** Adds space around lists for better organization <br>
* **List Colors:** This adds a colored border to the top of your lists (use Trello colors) <br>
* **List Pipes:** This shrinks your list small and only shows the BG image attached, shows data on hover <br>
* **List Projects:** This creates a way to see "Projects" more visually (best used with [cardsync]) <br>
* **Card Counts:** This displays number of cards in your list and takes on the color of your "List Color" <br>
* **Card Dates:** This adds visual animations to your cards with "Due Dates" <br>
* **Card Heights:** This sets a minimum height on cards so you see more information overall <br>
* **Card Labels:** This adds specific styling to your cards <br>
<br>
